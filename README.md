# ShredzUI
 
Invisible/transparent frames using oUF to be used in conjunction with WA "unitframes". Edit the actual frames under modules/oUF_frames.lua

Also includes an addon that sets a few cvars (clamping nameplates within screen etc) and the UI scale to be pixel perfect according to your resolution. Comment out UIScale.lua from the modules/Load_Modules.xml file if you dont want to load this.
